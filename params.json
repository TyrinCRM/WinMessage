It works by connecting to a WebSocket\r\nserver called Remote Messages, which must be installed on your device\r\nin order to use WinMessage.\r\n\r\n# Get WinMessage\r\n## You can download the latest build [here](https://github.com/0xFireball/WinMessage/releases/download/v1.0.1/WinMessageSetup.exe).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xFireball/WinMessage/master/screenshot.PNG)\r\n\r\n# About/Server Requirements\r\n- WinMessage uses the Remote Messages server.\r\nYou must first install this on your iOS device in order to use\r\nWinMessage.\r\n- WinMessage may disconnect from the iOS device after some time;\r\nthis can be solved by plugging the device in to a power source. \r\n\r\n# Build\r\n - Build with a developer command prompt, run releasebuild.bat.\r\n - WinMessage depends on Awesomium.NET; in order to build WinMessage,\r\n you will have to install the Awesomium.NET SDK.\r\n - Prebuilt releases are available.\r\n \r\n \r\n # License Information\r\n - WinMessage is FREE SOFTWARE, however, you may not distribute or modify\r\n it without explicit permission. We may decide to add an open-source\r\n license in the future, but for the time being, distribution and\r\n commercial use are explicitly prohibited. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
