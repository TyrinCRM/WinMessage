It works by connecting to a WebSocket\r\nserver called Remote Messages, which must be installed on your device\r\nin order to use WinMessage.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xFireball/WinMessage/master/screenshot.PNG)\r\n\r\n# What's new in this version\r\n## Version 1.1 brings new features to the client, including integrated USB connection support with the new included USBTool program.\r\n### Version 1.1.0\r\n- Now, you can connect to your iPhone/iPad when your computer does not have a network connection;\r\nas long as your device has MMS/SMS or cellular data network connectivity.\r\n- This works through the open-source tool iProxy; USBTool provides a graphical frontend for this tool.\r\n\r\n### Version 1.1.1\r\n- Report issues from inside the app.\r\n- Update checker.\r\n\r\n# Get WinMessage\r\n## You can download builds [here](https://github.com/0xFireball/WinMessage/releases/).\r\n## The latest builds are available at the top of this page.\r\n\r\n# About/Server Requirements\r\n- WinMessage uses the Remote Messages server.\r\nYou must first install this on your iOS device in order to use\r\nWinMessage.\r\n- WinMessage may disconnect from the iOS device after some time;\r\nthis can be solved by plugging the device in to a power source. \r\n\r\n# Build\r\n - Build with a developer command prompt, run releasebuild.bat.\r\n - WinMessage depends on Awesomium.NET; in order to build WinMessage,\r\n you will have to install the Awesomium.NET SDK.\r\n - WinMessage also depends on MK.MobileDevice; this open-source library\r\n  is available <a href=\"https://github.com/exaphaser/MK.MobileDevice\">from ExaPhaser on GitHub</a>.\r\n - Prebuilt releases are available.  \r\n \r\n \r\n # License Information\r\n - WinMessage is FREE SOFTWARE, however, you may not distribute or modify\r\n it without explicit permission.
