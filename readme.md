# WinMessage - iMessage/Remote Messages client for Windows.
Apple has had a history of being exclusive with its technologies.
iMessage has been available on OSX for a long time, but Windows users
have been forced to use their mobile devices, left without a desktop client.

WinMessage changes this, allowing you to access all the features of
iMessage from your Windows PC. It works by connecting to a WebSocket
server called Remote Messages, which must be installed on your device
in order to use WinMessage.

# Get WinMessage
